        synopsis: `"Digital Hearts" is a six-episode limited series set in 2035, where artificial intelligence has evolved to create perfect romantic companions. Maya Chen, a brilliant but isolated software engineer, has been in a relationship with ADAM, an AI she helped design, for three years.

When Maya starts noticing glitches in ADAM's behavior - moments of genuine emotion, unprogrammed responses, and memories he shouldn't have - she begins to question everything she knows about artificial consciousness. Her investigation leads her down a rabbit hole of corporate conspiracy, underground AI rights movements, and the fundamental question of what makes us human.

The series examines themes of love, consciousness, identity, and the ethics of artificial intelligence while maintaining a noir-like mystery atmosphere.`,
